                            . Released in October 2004 for Windows, it is a remake of Counter-Strike (2000) using

                            game engine. As in the original, Counter-Strike: Source pits a team of counter-terrorists
                            against a
                            team
                            of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective
                            (such
                            as
                            detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the enemy team. The
                            game
                            was
                            initially bundled with all retail and digital copies of Half-Life 2, before being released
                            standalone.

                            SourceMod, and EventScripts build on the basic RCON commands as well as gameplay
                            customizations.

                        <p>The ability to add new models and skins to
                            Counter-Strike: Source
                            allows for a large amount
                            of
                            customization. Skins refers to the actual images applied to parts of the game. The player
                            models,
                            weapon
                            models, and maps themselves can be "reskinned" (or "retextured") by anybody. Models refers
                            to
                            the
                            actual
                            3D-elements displayed on screen. Available is a server side variable to ensure only certain
                            models
                            and
                            materials are used, intending to stop material-based wallhacks. Not all servers use this
                            limitation
                            as
                            it is optional.</p>
                        <p>Models can be changed either by the player adding files to their cstrike folder, or by the
                            server
                            they
                            are playing on using a server-side plugin. The difference is that if a player changes a
                            model on
                            his
                            or
                            her own machine, only that player will see the changes, but if the model is altered by a
                            server-side
                            plugin or tool, then the model that the player is wearing is seen by everyone on that server
                            at
                            that
                            time. Also, the server can choose to force a "skin-consistency", meaning that any custom
                            skins
                            that
                            any
                            players may have will appear as the default model.</p>
                        <p>
                            After the Steam-pipe update, custom models will only load when the required files are put
                            into a
                            folder
                            named custom in the cstrike directory. In addition, skins enforcing for local server can be
                            disabled
                            with the console command <span class="console">sv_pure -1</span>.</p>
