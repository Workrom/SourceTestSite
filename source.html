                            third-party companies, and (much like GoldSrc) countless community mods by people around the

                            with
                            at least 100 games developed on Source. The engine also has several branches, each with new

                            added and improved graphical capabilities.

                            third-party
                            companies due to the lack of some Source 2 documentation and was rarely licensed to

                            developers compared to Source, and it's still regularly being maintained with engine and
                            security
                            updates.

                        of terrorists in a series of rounds. Each round is won either by completing an objective

                        detonating a bomb or rescuing hostages) or by eliminating all members of the enemy team. The

                        is the award-winning, free-to-play Hero Shooter from Respawn Entertainment.

                        ever-growing roster of legendary characters with powerful abilities, and experience

                        and innovative gameplay in the next evolution of Hero Shooter and Battle Royale. The game is
                        a spinoff
                        title of Titanfall series, and was set in the Titanfall universe.

                        , but the engine has been improved to allow higher draw distances
                        and a larger
                        game map, this apparently pushed the engine to its limit and as a result, the game has
                        compromises on
                        dynamic display resolution, and this led to the console ports and low end PCs suffering from
                        lower image
                        quality & framerate.
